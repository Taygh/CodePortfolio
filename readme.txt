Software: Text Game Engine
Author: Taygh Singh Atwal

Welcome to the Text Game Engine! The goal of this software is to provide average gamers a way to create their 
own narrative experiences with zero coding. All you have to do is follow the guidelines laid out by the 
included "dialogue" and "responses" files. Make sure you keep the program in the same folder as these text files
or any other text files you may create. If you want to see an example story in action, use the template
story included with the game. Other than that, you should be good to go! Have fun!

For those who are interested, this engine was coded from scratch using the following in C++:
-Stacks for the dialogue and responses (via linked lists)
-Throwing exceptions following standards for Stack ADTs 
-Dynamic memory allocation
-Time maniulation via the "chrono" libraries
-Big Four (default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, overloaded assignment operator)
-General parts of a program including: aggregate data types, control structures, loops, functions, etc.
